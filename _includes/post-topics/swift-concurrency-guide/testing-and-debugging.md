Testing and Debugging

---

Testing and debugging concurrency in Swift requires specialized tools and practices to ensure that asynchronous code behaves as expected under different conditions.

#### Unit Testing Asynchronous Code

- XCTest, Swift Testing supports asynchronous tests using the `async` keyword.

**XCTest and Async/Await**
```swift
import XCTest

class NetworkTests: XCTestCase {
    func testFetchData() async throws {
        let data = try await fetchData(from: "https://example.com")
        XCTAssertNotNil(data)
    }
}
```

**Testing Task Groups**
```swift
func testParallelProcessing() async throws {
    let results = try await withTaskGroup(of: Int.self) { group -> [Int] in
        for i in 1...5 {
            group.addTask { i * i }
        }
        var results: [Int] = []
        for try await result in group {
            results.append(result)
        }
        return results
    }
    XCTAssertEqual(results.sorted(), [1, 4, 9, 16, 25])
}
```

**Testing Cancellation**
```swift
func testTaskCancellation() async {
    let task = Task {
        while !Task.isCancelled {
            print("Task is running")
        }
    }
    task.cancel()
    await task.value
    XCTAssertTrue(Task.isCancelled)
}
```

#### Debugging Concurrency

- Add logs to track task creation, execution, and cancellation.
- Use Instruments to analyze relationships between parent and child tasks.
- Check task states like running, suspended, and canceled.
- Ensure actors serialize access to their state.

**Async Call Stack**
- View the execution flow of asynchronous code in Xcode.
- Use breakpoints in `async` functions to step through code.

**Concurrency Instrument in Instruments**
- Profile tasks, actors, and task groups.
- Identify bottlenecks, long-running tasks, and contention points.

**Deadlocks**
Deadlocks occur when tasks wait indefinitely for each other. Avoid them by designing clear task hierarchies.

Debugging Deadlocks
1. Use the thread debugger in Xcode to inspect thread states.
2. Check for circular dependencies in task interactions.

**Data Races**
Data races happen when multiple tasks access shared mutable data simultaneously.

1. Use actors to isolate state.
2. Annotate shared state with `@Sendable`.

**Debugging Actors**

Actors simplify debugging by isolating state. Use `@MainActor` to debug UI-related concurrency.

#### Example:
```swift
@MainActor
actor Logger {
    func log(_ message: String) {
        print(message)
    }
}
```

**Task Traces**

- Swift Concurrency provides tools to trace task execution using Instruments.

1. Task Hierarchy Visualization - view relationships between tasks and their parents.
2. Execution Timelines - analyze task execution times.
3. State Transitions - trace state changes (e.g., pending, running, suspended).

**Debugging and Optimization**

1. Use Instruments for Tracing - profile task execution to identify bottlenecks.
2. Log Task Events - add custom logs to trace task creation and completion.
3. Aggregate Task Metrics - monitor task group execution time and resource usage.
4. Ensure proper task-scoping to maintain resource efficiency.
